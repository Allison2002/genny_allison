                <p>From a young age, I’ve embraced the challenge of self-education, honing a strong ability to teach myself new concepts and skills. My academic journey took a unique path when I was homeschooled from 6th grade through high school graduation. This experience not only fostered my independence but also ingrained in me a deep-seated passion for learning. I have always taken the initiative to educate myself whenever I encounter something unfamiliar, and this self-driven approach has led to consistent success in everything I undertake.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the importance of staying ahead in the fast-evolving field of web development, I’ve sought out numerous resources to build a solid foundation in Web Development. I’ve utilized platforms such as <strong>Devslopes, Code Academy, freecodecamp.org, YouTube, LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, and ChatGPT</strong>, among many others. These tools have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the concepts and skills required to excel as a Web Developer. My thirst for knowledge goes beyond the basics; I am driven to explore how every element works together, which is why I chose to pursue Full Stack Development rather than settling for just Front-End Development.</p>
